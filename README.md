# Neurotool
Neurotool is a software tool which helps you to analyze if there's a modulation between spindles, slow waves, and spike trains in EEG or ECoG data recorded in animal or human brain. This is achieved by detecting spindles and slow waves inside the data automatically and plotting phase aligned spike trains before, during, and after the each event. You can have a deeper understanding of Neurotool by reviewing the pipelines and guide notebooks!!

## Pipelines

The Jupyter notebook pipelines are really what make Neurotool great! In addition to showing how to use the main functions of Neurotool, they also provide a system where you can extract your data as numpy arrays and easily finish the analysis in a few minutes. 

## Notebooks

In the guide_notebooks folder you can see there are three Jupyter Notebook files. Each are prepared to explain every single function coded in Neurotool libraries, so that you can easily understand them and use them in your own systems! For additional information you can always check the comment lines in .py files.

## Development

This tool is developed by Mert Unsal under supervision of PhD. Tansel Baran Yasar at ETH Zurich Neuroinformatics Lab. Contributions are more than welcome so feel free to contact me [here](mailto:mailmertunsal@gmail.com), open an issue or submit a pull request!
